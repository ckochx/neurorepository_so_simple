##Organization

The UINR has two advisory committees that provide guidance on strategic planning, development, and community engagement.  The Medical Advisory Committee is responsible for providing expertise on advancing the medical research mission of the repository, providing insight into the medical techniques and ethics associated with the various disease specific processes, and recommending additional avenues for collaboration with the medical profession.  The Bioinformatics Advisory Committee is responsible for providing expertise to guide the development of complex disease data sets, creation and integration of analytical tools, and identification of resources to advance the utility and accessibility.

##Leadership

###Jeffrey Loeb, MD, PhD
####Director and Principal Investigator

Dr. Loeb currently serves as the department head of the UIC Department of Neurology & Rehabilitation and previously was a professor in the department of neurology and the associate director of The Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics at Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit, Michigan. He received his MD and PhD from the University of Chicago and went on to complete a residency in neurology at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston then followed by fellowship training in epilepsy and clinical neurophysiology at Harvardâ€™s Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital. At the same time, Dr. Loeb held a faculty appointment at the Harvard Medical School where he performed research on nervous system development with Gerald Fischbach in the Department of Neurobiology.

During his 20 year career, Dr. Loeb has authored numerous publications and has been the recipient of research and teaching awards. Among these awards, Dr. Loeb has been listed as one of the Best Doctors in America 2007-2013, and honored by Wayne State University with the Outstanding Graduate mentor Award and numerous Faculty Research Awards. He is a member of the American Academy of Neurology, the American Epilepsy Society, the Society for Neuroscience, and the American Neurological Association. He is on the professional advisory board of the Epilepsy Foundation of America and is a regular member of the developmental neuroscience NICHD NIH study section.

Dr. Loeb has made important contributions to neurological science in the fields of neuregulins in development as well as the functional and genomics of human epilepsy and has been actively translating these basic discoveries into novel therapeutics for neurological disorders ranging from multiple sclerosis, ALS, and epilepsy. He is the recipient of multiple grants from the NIH, NSF, and many private foundations and continues to excel in the arena of translational medicine. Dr. Loeb brings to UIC a strong reputation for successful, multidisciplinary program development and collaboration with both academic and private industry to produce important research and new approaches to neurological treatments including pioneering a systems biology approach that links genes, proteins, and molecules to epileptic activities in the human brain. Further, he is one of the pioneers in the field of growth factor signaling in motor neurons and the developer of novel, patented therapeutics for a variety of human diseases, including the development of an innovative drug targeting technology that could significantly improve the treatment of brain disorders and cancer.
